# SwiftUI PassCode Input 

**Note:** this project is currently under aggressive development, please _do not_ use it in a production application.

Features:
- Configurable amount of cells
- Cursor jumps forward as user enters digits
- Cursor jumps backwards as user clears input
- Support for user arbitrarily navigating between cells
- Abstracted data model
- Built for SwiftUI

Planned Features:
- Restrict input to nominated character sets
- Configurable input boxes
- Group input boxes
